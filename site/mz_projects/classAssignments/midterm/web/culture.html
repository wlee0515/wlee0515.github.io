<h2>Caribbean Culture --- Music</h2>
<p>Hoo-Hoo, who was apparently of the same age as Edwin, grinned.</p>

<p>"All you want, Granser. I got four."</p>

<p>The old man's palsied eagerness was pitiful. Sitting down in the sand as  quickly as his stiff limbs would let him, he poked a large rock-mussel  from out of the coals. The heat had forced its shells apart, and  the meat, salmon-colored, was thoroughly cooked. Between thumb and  forefinger, in trembling haste, he caught the morsel and carried it  to his mouth. But it was too hot, and the next moment was violently  ejected. The old man spluttered with the pain, and tears ran out of his  eyes and down his cheeks.</p>

<p>The boys were true savages, possessing only the cruel humor of the  savage. To them the incident was excruciatingly funny, and they burst  into loud laughter. Hoo-Hoo danced up and down, while Edwin rolled  gleefully on the ground. The boy with the goats came running to join in  the fun.</p>

<p>"Set 'em to cool, Edwin, set 'em to cool," the old man besought, in the  midst of his grief, making no attempt to wipe away the tears that  still flowed from his eyes. "And cool a crab, Edwin, too. You know your  grandsire likes crabs."</p>

<p>From the coals arose a great sizzling, which proceeded from the many  mussels bursting open their shells and exuding their moisture. They were  large shellfish, running from three to six inches in length. The boys  raked them out with sticks and placed them on a large piece of driftwood  to cool.</p>

<p>The next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all shook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them as far as the gate.  When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered greatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble.  But he at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and gave them many good wishes to carry with them.</p>

<p>"You are now our ruler," he said to the Scarecrow; "so you must come back to us as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall if I am able," the Scarecrow replied; "but I must help Dorothy to get home, first."</p>

<p>As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:</p>

<p>"I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has been good to me.  I cannot tell you how grateful I am."</p>
